# Modernize a legacy application using a co-existence layer 

App modernization is the process of improving your current applications - or building entirely new ones - to take advantage of new, innovative tech. There needs to be a practical approach to move your legacy applications to new technologies without disrupting the current operations. Legacy applications could be a monolith with tightly coupled modules. The move to new technologies needs to be an incremental approach.

In this code pattern, we will take the scenario of a telecom company that provides mobile network services. The comany has a legacy application with a number of functional modules for customer information management, mobile plans management, inventory management and billing. The telecom company now wants to build a new system of engagement with an interactive chatbot for the customers. In the new chatbot the customers can query for billing information, data usage and also get plan recommendations. It is proposed to build this new chatbot using new technologies but without disrupting the existing legacy system.
