# Liberty getting started application
The Getting Started tutorial for Liberty uses this sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working with any Liberty app on IBM Cloud or in IBM Cloud Private; you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on the cloud, and then integrate an IBM Cloud database service in your app.

The Liberty app may use either the [Cloudant Java Client](https://github.com/cloudant/java-cloudant) or the [MongoDB Java Client](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver) to add information to a database and then return information from a database to the UI.

The user enters the name, Mary and the screen refreshes to display, Hello, Mary, I've added you to the database. The database contents listed are now Mary, Joe, Jane, and Bob.">

## Before you begin

You'll need a [IBM Cloud account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads), and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed. If you use [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/products/ibm-cloud-private/), you need access to the [IBM Cloud Private Cloud Foundry](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0/cloud_foundry/overview.html) environment.

## Instructions

**IBM Cloud Cloud Foundry**: [Getting started tutorial for Liberty](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-getting-started-liberty).

**IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service**: [README_kubernetes.md](README_kubernetes.md)

**IBM Cloud Private**: The starter application for IBM Cloud Private guides you through a similar process. However, instead of hosting both your service and application in the same cloud environment, you use a user-provided service. This guide shows you how to deploy your application to IBM Cloud Private and bind it to a Cloudant Database in IBM Cloud. For the complete procedure, see [Working with user-provided services and the Liberty starter app](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0/cloud_foundry/buildpacks/buildpacks_using_Libertyapp.html).
